      "comment": "How do you write these fics of yours? Like the idea, planning, editing, character development, etc (whatever you want)? Especially the longer one, cause wow!! I love the development of your stories so much and can see the thought and effort you put into it!!",
      "reply": "shamefully, i don't plan my fics at all. no outline, i just begin with vibes and develop the plot/overall theme/conflict out of the scenes that i write down. i will go back and edit scenes so they fit to the common thread running through the fic if i have to. that's why my non-pwp fics usually have no 'trope' plots and are more of a slice of life, character study vibe, centered on a character who has issues or something that needs to be worked out between the central characters. my lack of outlining or preplanning is kind of the reason i have 5x more wips than i do published fics (and i have 40 published fics), but outlining has never really worked for me so it is what it is.\n\ntypically, the ideas for a fic comes from moments i see between members or something they said or a dynamic between them i'm interested in exploring. so the jayke i posted recently, i wanted to explore the dynamic of how you could argue jake is everyone's 'favorite' (and converted that into them all having feelings for him) but how that can be harmful. also his recent interview about being guarded inspired the character introspection side of it and the explanation of why he behaves that way. and then some of the scenes i included were directly inspired from jayke moments at the beginning of this year and also jay's agenda for puppy jake; hence the puppy play. i just get struck by a concept and want to write it.\n\ncharacter development usually centers around the character i give issues cause they're the pov of the story. sometimes i try to think from the character's pov, like what would they do in this situation at their current mental/emotional/physical state and i find that works for me? other times it's like okay, i wrote a beginning scene where character A is starting at this point mentally, emotionally, and relationship wise, and then i've written this later scene where character A has now moved to this point mentally, emotionally, and relationship wise. so what are the steps in between that need to be taken to move them there. but i will also say, most of this is subconscious. i don't really actively think how should i develop this character, i follow instinct. i think we subconsciously understand how people work, think, and act better than we might expect, so i just trust where my brain is taking me.\n\ni'm also not a very consistent writer, i write in fits and bursts. i won't touch a fic for a month and then i'll write half of it in three days. but in a way that space between writing sessions means i can review my fic with fresh eyes and pick out anything that doesn't make sense or isn't explained enough or completely unnecessary. \n\nbut yeah the development of my fics is usually a lot of me trusting my instincts, asking myself does this make sense for the characters to do, and trying to get characters from point A to point B.",

This vid is just one out of the many times he did this. And the way he kept wearing that ring too?? I just, i cant fathom the level of closeness one can feel toward a friend and maybe coz ive never experienced that type of relationship..",
      "reply": "gfjdkagh anon why did you start confessing at the end all of a sudden... honestly jake and sunghoon's relationship is very precious and you can see that sunghoon really enjoys jake's company and likes spending quite a lot of time with him, even if it's just quietly. i think it's that thing where you want to stick by your best friend even if you're in a group full of your closest friends, and i think it's safe to say that they're best friends. \n\nthe consistency with wearing the ring is also very sweet and it makes me TT i think partly he got used to wearing it and also it's really nice to have something matching with your best friend (or boyfriend, if i put my delusional cap on)!! i will say matching rings or other jewelry does happen between best friends but i choose to believe it's because they're going to get married <3 but regardless, that kind of closeness is heartwarming.",

      "comment": "I saw someone saying heehoonk! are the satellites of jk, don’t you think this is more suitable than sunshine protectors bcoz jk is capable enough to protect himself and jk is kinda like the moon instead of sunshine with the way the members describe Jk as someone whose presence provide them with comfort, peace and someone who they seek during times that gets hard and during times when they wanna hide themselves. Excluding nk of course because that man doesn’t want to show his vulnerability towards jk 😂he wants to be the big in his relationship with jk",
      "reply": "jake does remind me more of the moon or the stars than the sun to be honest, even though he's very bright and warm. but i think it's his comfort that the members adore more than anything, which is definitely something i associate with the moon. he is playful and loud and cheery, but it's his quieter moments and his easy affection with the members that are touching. he's very soft-spoken and gentle when he's at a normal energy. the members also talk about how he's very good at listening and tells you what you need to hear, which again, many such themes and tropes about talking to the moon and how the moon is a good listener. so yeah, i do really agree that jake is the moon. \n\nand heehoonki are his devoted satellites. they revolve around him sometimes like on stage, they always find their way back to his side, they're always looking to him when they're talking or laughing, they seek him out to spend time with him. also, yeah niki wants to appear more mature with jake and he's always talking about how he wants to be the hyung/jake to be the dongsaeng, but i do think he shows his vulnerabilities with jake. i feel like they've mentioned it before, that niki confides in jake, which is really sweet. whenever those kinds of questions about who do you find comfort in come up, it's unanimously jake. everyone trusts him so much because he has such an open and warm soul, which you can practically feel through the screen.\n\nand anyway i find it so cute how niki tries to appear like the older one in his relationship with jake but then you see so many moments where it's jake giving in to his demands or wants with some exasperation like a mom with a rambunctious son (he puts up a slight fight cause he's the youngest at home but he's long gotten used to babying niki)",

The staff from the show calling them a parakeet (love bird) couple and talking about how when Jake was gone, all Sunghoon would talk about is Jake, I miss Jake, I feel so lonely/empty without Jake? \n\n(cont.)",

      "reply": "favorite part about jayke is how jake pushes and pushes with jay and jay kind of just lets him. said this before to friends but theyre so old married couple, but jakes like the exasperated wife and jay is the husband who cant seem to do anything right. that one enoclock ep where theyre measuring leg lengths and jake yells at jay, the best part is how jay starts to quietly confess that he hasnt measured yet but just trails off because he knows hes about to be yelled at and then jake delivers. man, never seen jake that mad before on screen. but they both let go of anger easily. theyre bickering like mad one second (jake usually winning because jay lets himself be pushed around) and then just buddy buddy the next because they both have flash fire tempers, really hot one moment and then theyve forgotten it the next.\n\nalso jake is so.... hes so funny. he doesnt really back off and jay gets offended easily (even if he gets over it fast), so he gets on jays nerves so easily. like everyone teases jay but they know when to ease off and back off, start appeasing jay to make sure hes not actually offended. jake doesnt give a fuck, he just dishes it out and jay gets all pouty and upset but he never snaps at jake. like he'll maybe yell back but you've never actually seen him get mad at jake. \n\nbut theyre both also caretakers in their own ways and watching their softer moments is just so,,, so gentle, so lovely. the way jakes not usually one to get shy, but whenever jay is being sincere and affectionate, jake gets so fucking shy. like its really only jay who makes jake shy, i love it. also jay? and his puppy jake agenda? like man keep the pet play in the bedroom. and!! recently!! they have been super loud and super cute with each other!! before a lot of it was bickering but now its way softer and affectionate and sweeter and its so lovely to see",

      "reply": "thank you for saying this, really relieved to hear it! i was worried about the characterization of the non-gybrik folks cause i dont have as strong a feel for their characters yet. im glad it translated well to you!! yujin being absolutely over gyubrik is hilarious to me cause he has that teenage angst going for him irl, absolutely tired of his hyungs.\n\nthe baby cloud appearance was actually pulled straight from my fantasies, i was foaming at the mouth watching them with the kids. rik was so gentle and soft spoken and, just, we had to say mother. he's so lovelicky!!! gyub is so dad. so entirely dad. gyubrik are very versatile you're right. i have other ideas for them, but we'll see what gets written.",
